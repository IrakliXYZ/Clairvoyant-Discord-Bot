# Clairvoyant Discord Bot

This code is used to run a simple Discord bot that will read and respond to user messages. It includes the matching package to detect messages even with typos and slight mistakes. Also features the time delay to make bot feel more natural.


## Usage

To invite the bot to your server use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=877917249502072862&permissions=116800&scope=bot). Do not forget to grant permissions to the bot to let it work properly.

To deploy your own bot: fork this repository, create your bot on Discord developer portal, copy the token, deploy this code on a server and add the token as a secret or .env file.

```.env
TOKEN = “YourTokenGoesHere”
```
